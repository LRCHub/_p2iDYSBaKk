```
Say,
do you like the way it moves
The circle motions of the gloom
Truth escapes the light
when neon shadows dance
under the moon
Now raw emotion is in power
The hand and of god
will strike the hour
Light is blinding but through
shadows of the dark my eyes
see true
One step out of the light
We begin to surrender
to the call of the night
Two steps taken for life
And forever give yourself
to the call
To the call of the night
I have seen the depths
of the dark well
I know the stories it can tell
The allure of danger,
strangers and the promises
they sell
The burden of human desire
Shines through darkness
like a fire
When the smoke is gone
the devastation's clear
as daylight view
One step out of the light
We begin to surrender
to the call of the night
Two steps taken for life
And forever give yourself
to the call
To the call of the night
(One step out of the light
We begin to surrender
to the call of the night
Two steps taken for life
And forever give yourself
to the call
To the call of the night)
One step out of the light
We begin to surrender
to the call of the night
Two steps taken for life
And forever give yourself
to the call
To the call of the night
One step out of the light
We begin to surrender
to the call of the night
Two steps taken for life
And forever give yourself
to the call
To the call of the...
Night...
